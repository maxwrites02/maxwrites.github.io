      <description>Feeling less focused and creative lately. It feels like I am operating on auto-pilot in every aspect of my life. I go to the gym in the morning and there too I feel like I am operating on auto-pilot. I am doing things just for the sake of doing them. I do all these things without getting focused meaning I am not fully focused into the work I am doing. Even when I am eating food I constantly scroll YouTube feed on my tablet.</description>
