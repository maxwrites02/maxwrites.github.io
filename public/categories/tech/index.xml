      <description>My Google account was compromised for 6 months, and google sent me no security notification regarding this. On 22 Aug, Google sent me a notification that &amp;ldquo;you signed out from your device&amp;rdquo; when I was watching YouTube on my Android device. When I checked in my Google Account dashboard, it showed that my Gmail was logged out from Germany. My Gmail had been logged into that device since Feb, 2025. My Google account has had 2FA enabled for the past four years, since I created this account.</description>

      <description>I was on Arch Linux when I decided to leave the &amp;ldquo;Linux ecosystem&amp;rdquo; and move back to Windows. I have four gigs of ram in my laptop and a SSD which is enough for my use case. I am not a super user; I use my PC to write essays, watching YouTube videos and sometimes light Photoshop work. Last year, I decided to move back to Windows because the Arch maintenance was too much for me.</description>
