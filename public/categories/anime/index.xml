      <description>The episodes of season 3 of SpyxFamily has started airing. I have been waiting for this season for a almost two years now. And, finally it has arrived. Currently, they have released two episodes and I have watched both of them.&#xA;The first one was not good in my opinion. It was slow paced and felt dull, boring and repetitive. I can&amp;rsquo;t point out which part was repetitive, but it definitely was boring to sit through 20 minutes of that episode.</description>
