      <description>I am living in New Delhi for a month now, and yesterday I got a chance to try the infamous dish, Biryani. In my state, Biryani is not a common dish and cannot be found at the major places, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it tastes and what&amp;rsquo;s the standard taste for biryani, but the biryani I ate last night was very flavourful and tasty.&#xA;There were two types of biryani on the shop; Hyderabadi and Muradabadi.</description>
