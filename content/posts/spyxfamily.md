The episodes of season 3 of SpyxFamily has started airing. I have been waiting
for this season for a almost two years now. And, finally it has arrived.
Currently, they have released two episodes and I have watched both of them. 

The first one was not good in my opinion. It was slow paced and felt dull,
boring and repetitive. I can't point out which part was repetitive, but it
definitely was boring to sit through 20 minutes of that episode. Whereas, the
second episode was somewhat better than the first. I liked the Loid's childhood
story and the arrival of the new teacher? in the Eden College.

I am looking forward for the episode 3 which is set to release tomorrow (Oct 18,
2025). If I have to rate these two episodes then I'll give 2/5 to Episode 1 and
3/5 to Episode 2. I hope that the future Episodes will be funny and better than
Ep1 and 2.
