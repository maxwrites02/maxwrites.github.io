My Google account was compromised for 6 months, and google sent me no security
notification regarding this. On 22 Aug, Google sent me a notification that "you
signed out from your device" when I was watching YouTube on my Android device.
When I checked in my Google Account dashboard, it showed that my Gmail was
logged out from Germany. My Gmail had been logged into that device since Feb,
2025. My Google account has had 2FA enabled for the past four years, since
I created this account. However, I received no notification or email that
someone had logged into my account.

My password was strong according to Google. I use Bitwarden for generating all
my passwords. I had photos and some important documents stored on this account.
After searching about this situation on Google and ChatGPT, I found that the
hackers might have stolen my cookie session or something similar. I also did
a complete antivirus scan of my Windows laptop, Windows Defender found nothing,
but on ChatGpt's suggestion, I re-scanned with Malwarebytes Antivirus, and it
detected the malware and information logger on my system. I used to think
Windows Defender was enough but the paid antivirus software is still better.

This malware was inside the folder of the pirated software which I downloaded
from the site called getintopc.com. I was using this website to download
software for seven years and never had any trouble but this time was different.
After discovering these things, I quickly installed the Linux Mint and deleted
Windows 10 completely from my hard drive. I was paranoid that the hacker might
have installed keylogger, that's why I switched to Linux. I removed my phone
number and started using Aegis Authenticator app for 2FA on Google. I also have
decided to de-google my tools and deleted all my documents and photos from their
platform after taking a backup.

The hacker was in my google account for six months and I have no idea what they
took from me in this period, as I had my photos in Google Photos and some
important documents in Google Drive. As I said above, I am de-googling my tools,
so far I have changed my email to protonmail (free version). It only comes with
500mb, so maybe I'll upgrade in the future. And for my photos and notes, I will
not use any cloud services from now on and will store everything on my hard
drive and pen drives. I was a little critical of Linux in one of my blogs, but
after this incident, I have decided to shift to Linux completely.

Update: I am back on Windows 10 LTSC IOT :|
