Feeling less focused and creative lately. It feels like I am operating on
auto-pilot in every aspect of my life. I go to the gym in the morning and there
too I feel like I am operating on auto-pilot. I am doing things just for the
sake of doing them. I do all these things without getting focused meaning I am
not fully focused into the work I am doing. Even when I am eating food
I constantly scroll YouTube feed on my tablet.

I have also noticed that the more I spend my time in front of screens, the more
I become a zombie. I have an average of ten hour screen time this month, can be
more than that. And I think spending too much time with these devices are
messing up with my brain chemicals. I know what's the solution is, but I don't
think so my brain is ready to accept it. The solution is to completely stop
using the social media (I don't have account on any social media except
YouTube).

Whenever, I decide to implement this solution on myself, I fail terribly every
time. Except one time when I didn't used any device for a week. During that time
I felt more "alive" I felt like I can focus on any task easily and can hold my
concentration for long. I always feel brain-fog when I am on college vacations
because my screen time goes up two-three folds up. There is one more thing which
I will be doing along with complete boycott of social media usage. I will be
"actively" looking for my movements such as "how many times I am touching my
devices", "how many times I am opening my devices" and "Why I am doing that".

For some it feels like too much, but heavy social media usage and long screen
time is the issue which all people face today. An average Indian's screen time
is five to seven hours, according to the [IIM Rohtak study](https://www.financialexpress.com/jobs-career/we-need-to-use-the-social-media-for-self-development-in-addition-to-entertainment-iim-rohtak-research-3364495/).
The social media's algortihm designed to glue the attention of individuals to
their screen is the main culprit. It doesn't matter how much self control you
have you just can't win against the team of psychologists, who are creating new
ideas to trap your attention.
