This is a rant post.

I have decided to not buy or order anything from online websites like Amazon,
Flipkart, Zomato, Blinkit etc. These services are not meant for convenience
anymore, these websites have started charging convenience charges if you order
something from them. I can let the convenience charges pass, but charging extra
money for Cash On Delivery option is not good and, these charges changes
according to the order's cost. One more ridiculous charge is the handling fee;
they're charging Rs 100-200 as a handling fee and when the package arrives, the
packaging isn't even that great.

Yesterday, I purchased a soundbar from Flipkart. It came without the Flipkart
carton box, they charged all kinds of fees at the time of order checkout like
a "super secure" fee, handling fee, breathing fee but still the package came
without any carton box. So if they're not going to pack my package properly,
than why are they charging these ridiculous fees?

I tested the soundbar, and it was little underpowered for my usecase, so
I decided to return it. All the return options were related to faulty product,
meaning you can only return the product if there is a fault and even then, they
will schedule a call with you to solve the "problem". You can't even return your
order without going through interrogation. All these sites boast about their
7days easy replacement/return policy but reality is very different. I ended up
not returning it because I don't want to go through this hell of a system.

Now, let's talk about Zomato. They charge double and sometimes triple the price
of dish. They also have ridiculous "platform fee" and the GST charges makes your
regular order 3-4x more expensive if you go to the restaurant directly. For
example, the restaurant where I eat momos sell 1 plate (10 pcs) for Rs 70, but
if I order from Zomato I have to pay Rs 190-200. It's almost 3x expensive than,
if you eat in the restaurant.

So, I have decided that I will buy the things from local market only. These
companies will not be getting my money anymore. I may use Amazon for ordering
books, as I don't have a good bookstore near me. But Flipkart and Zomato are
dead to me.
