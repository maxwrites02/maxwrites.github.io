This is my all time favourite and easy recipe to cook mutton curry. The
ingredients can be easily found. This is my first time writing recipe/cooking
post, if you want to give me any suggestion or feedback, you can find my email
at the bottom of this page. In this recipe, I am using 500g mutton.

Ingredients:

 - 500g Mutton
 - 2 Cup Mustard Oil/ Cooking Oil
 - 2 Small to Medium Sized Onion
 - 2 Small to Medium Sized Tomatoes
 - 2 Green Chillies
 - 2 Garlic Cloves
 - 2 Tbsp Yogurt
 - 1 Tbsp Salt
 - 1/2 Turmeric powder
 - 2 Tbsp Kashmiri Red Chilli Powder
 - 2-4 Tbsp Meat Masala
 - 2 Green Cardamom, 2 Cumin and 5-6 Black Pepper

 First, clean the mutton with water thoroughly. Make fine paste of Onion,
 tomatoes, green chillies and garlic. I recommend using mortar pestle for
 crushing garlic but if you don't have it, make sure the garlic cloves are
 finely chopped. Add the fine paste, and turmeric, salt, kashmiri red chilli
 powder into the mutton. Add yogurt with 1 tbsp of mustard oil and mix it well.
 Keep the marinated meat aside for 10-15 minutes.

 Now take a pot and pour mustard oil. Make sure the oil is well heated and add
 green cardamom, cumin and black pepper. Immediately add the marinated mutton
 and meat masala. Turn to high flame and start cooking/stirring mutton for 8-10
 minutes. When the water starts to reduce and the oil can be seen on the
 surface, turn to lowest flame possible and cover the lid for 5-10 minutes.

Little red layer of oil should be formed on the top. Now add 1 to 2 glass of
water, it depends on you how much curry you want, don't add too much water,
start with 2 glass of water and you can add more later if you want. Turn to the
high flame and stir the mutton and wait till one boil. Keep stirring for 1-2
minutes on high flame, cover the lid and turn to low flame and let it cook for
15-20 minutes.

Check after 15 minutes, if the meat is cooked. Garnish it with coriander, and the mutton curry is ready!!

The same recipe can be used for chicken also, but you have to adjust the
quantity of the ingredients according to the quantity of chicken.
