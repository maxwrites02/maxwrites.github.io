I was on Arch Linux when I decided to leave the "Linux ecosystem" and move back
to Windows. I have four gigs of ram in my laptop and a SSD which is enough for
my use case. I am not a super user; I use my PC to write essays, watching
YouTube videos and sometimes light Photoshop work. Last year, I decided to move
back to Windows because the Arch maintenance was
too much for me. I can't manage to have fours hours a day to fix the things,
which were perfectly working fine under Windows. I also tried other Linux
distros, but they all have font issues which makes my head blow up. The battery
life is also not great as compared to the Windows. Enough talking about Linux,
the reason I chose Windows 10 LTSC IOT:

 - Less Bloated
 - Security Updates till 2032

This Windows version is less bloated than Windows 10 Home and Pro. On Idle, it
consumes 1.8 to 2.0 gigs of ram which gives me 2.0 gigs of free ram in which
I can easily multitask with 1 tab open in Google Chrome and 2 tabs open in Brave
Browser. I used to use Firefox as my secondary browser before Brave, but it
feels sluggish compared to the brave browser. Windows 10 IOT doesn't come with
any garbage apps like candy crush, weather and this version also doesn't have
Microsoft Store. Although you can easily install it later.

The second good thing is it will get security updates till 2032 while the normal
Windows 10 version like Home and Pro will be not receive the security updates
from October, 2025. You can now pay for Windows ESU (Extended Security Updates)
for $30 per year. I don't want to pay any kind of money when I can get security
    updates till 2032 for free. I am not sure if any browser will be supporting
    this version for seven more years, maybe the inbuilt MS Edge will get
    updates. My laptop is still in good condition and I don't want to purchase
    a new machine, as I can still do most of my work on this machine without any
    trouble.

I'll definitely recommend this Windows 10 LTSC IOT version if you want to keep
getting security updates until 2032. My advise would be to not switch to any
kind of Linux distribution if you are a regular Joe and can't spare some time to
learn and fix things in Linux. The compatibility of the hardware can also be the
issue with Linux, so go with the safe route and install Windows.

The installation procedure is same as installing other Windows version. You can
get the ISO file on

notes on this page completely before making any decision.
