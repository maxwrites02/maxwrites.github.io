I am living in New Delhi for a month now, and yesterday I got a chance to try
the infamous dish, Biryani. In my state, Biryani is not a common dish and cannot
be found at the major places, so I don't know how it tastes and what's the
standard taste for biryani, but the biryani I ate last night was very flavourful
and tasty.

There were two types of biryani on the shop; Hyderabadi and Muradabadi. They ask
you at the counter that which one would you like. The Muradabadi one was like
a pulav with less masalas, whereas the Hyderabadi one was full of masalas. So
I decided to mix both of them and the flavours were so good.

Hyderabadi had all the masalas and flavours and the Muradabadi was sort of
cooling down or cutting the heat of the spices. I recommend mixing both of them
whenever you get a chance to try biryani. I took half a kilo option which costed
me around â‚¹130/- and it came with 4 or 5 chicken pieces, I don't remember
correctly. I'll definitely try it again whenever I get a chance to visit that
area back.
