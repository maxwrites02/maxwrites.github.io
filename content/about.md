Hi, I am a 22-year-old guy from India who likes to read books and play football
in his free time. Max used to be my Valorant username/pseudonym and now I use it
everywhere on the internet. I made this website by getting inspired from several
blogs on the internet, few examples are [bugswriter.com](https://bugswriter.com/), [digdeeper.club](https://digdeeper.club/),
[lukesmith.xyz](https://lukesmith.xyz/) and
[frugalcomputing.neocities.org](https://frugalcomputing.neocities.org/). I am
not a very techy guy like the people mentioned earlier but I like to learn new
things.

On this website, I post about my life experiences and happenings, anime,
computers, sports and food. This site doesn't come under any particular genre,
so you can find a lot of writings about different subjects. I write all my posts
by myself and don't use any AI tool. I don't have account on any social
media, I even watch YouTube on invidious or tubular without signing up. I don't
use any service which force me to create an account.

That's enough introduction for now I guess.
